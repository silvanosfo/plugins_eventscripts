# plugins_eventscripts
Random firstblood, grenade, headshot and knife kill sounds made in 2014 for EventScripts, for the game Counter Strike: Source.  
At the time there was no scripts avaliable that supported random event kill sounds, so i made my owns that fitted my requirements.  
Used at the RocKillers Community Portuguese servers @ 2013-2014.

<sub>This repo is just for reference to the first time i programmed something when i was a teenager.</sub>
